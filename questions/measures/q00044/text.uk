@ime1@ lives in Belgrade, and her friend @ime2@ moved to @town[ind]@. They often use "@"chat"@" to communicate on the Internet. In order to talk, they have to connect to the Internet at the same time. 
When it's 12@"h"@ in Belgrade, it's @t_town@@"h"@ in @padez[ind]@. 

@ime1@ and @ime2@ cannot talk between @amint[2]@@"h"@ and @pmint[1]@@"h"@ their time because they have to go to school. Also, they cannot talk between @pmint[2]@@"h"@ and @amint[1]@@"h"@ because they are sleeping at that time.
When can @ime1@ and @ime2@ talk? Write the time interval in local time.
