If the lengths of segments of the right four-sided pyramid, whose base is a rectangle, are known (picture):
@center@ @quest@,
@center@ @mycanvas()@
calculate (to one decimal place):
@center@ the length of the segment @hspacept(5)@ @edge[ind]@ = @lib.check_number(numb[ind])@@meas[1]@,
@center@ the surface area of the diagonal section  
@center@  @"Q = "@ @lib.check_number(area,50)@@meas[2]@.
