The sides of a rectangle are @"a"@ and @"b"@. What is the length of the side of a square that has the same area as the rectangle (expressed as a whole number)?

@repeat(3)@
@vspace@
@center@ @"a"@ = @edge_a@@measure[ind]@, @hspacept(3)@ @"b"@ = @edge_b@@measure[ind]@,  
@center@ The side of the square is @lib.check_number(edge_c,20)@@measure[ind]@.
