From a wooden cone with a radius of @numb[1]@"cm", a regular pyramid of the same height is cut out. The cone's base angle is @angle[ch]@.
@vspace@
What percentage of the wood is discarded? 
@center@ @lib.check_number(prop_v)@% of the wood is discarded.
@vspace@
What is the relationship between the surface areas of the pyramid and the cone?
@center@ The surface area of the pyramid is @lib.check_number(prop_p)@% of the cone's surface area.
