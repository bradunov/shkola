We know how to construct an angle of @"60"@@meas@ and the bisector of any angle, i.e. to determine the half of any angle.

@center@ @mycanvas()@

Using the labels from the figure, where @"sO"@ is the label of the angle obtained by bisecting angle O with the bisector, write how the given angle can be constructed by adding angles that we can construct. 
Example: @hspacept(5)@  75@meas@ = 60@meas@ + 15@meas@ = @"O + ssO"@
