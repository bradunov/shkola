A plane parallel to the base cuts the right cone so that the @elem[ch]@ of the base is @fct@ times @name[ch]@ than the @elem[ch+2]@ of the parallel cross-section. The height of the cone is @numb[2]@@"cm"@.
What is the height of the smaller cone whose base is the parallel cross-section and the apex is common to the given cup?
@center@ The height of the smaller cone (to one decimal place) is @hspacept(3)@ @lib.check_number(numb[3])@@"cm"@. 
@vspace@
What is the ratio of the base surface areas of the given and smaller cone?                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
@center@ The base surface area of the given cone is @hspacept(3)@ @lib.check_number(numb[4])@ @hspacept(3)@ times larger than the base surface area of the smaller cone.
