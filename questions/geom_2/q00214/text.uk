The wrapper of the cylinder is obtained by folding the rectangle sides @numb1@@meas[1]@ and @numb2@@meas[1]@ so that @elem[ind]@ sides match.
Calculate the surface area and volume of the cylinder (to one decimal place). Assume that @"π"@ = @"22/7"@.

@center@ The surface area of the cylinder is @hspacept(3)@ @lib.check_number(area,50)@@meas[2]@,
@center@ The volume of the cylinder is @hspacept(3)@ @lib.check_number(vol,50)@@meas[3]@.
