The envelope of the cylinder is obtained by folding the rectangle whose sides are @numb1@@meas[1]@ and @numb2@@meas[1]@, so that its @elem[ind]@ sides overlap.
Calculate the surface area and volume of the cylinder (to one decimal place). 
Assume that @"π"@ = @"22/7"@.

@center@ The surface area of the cylinder is @hspacept(3)@ @lib.check_number(area,50)@@meas[2]@,
@center@ The volume of the cylinder is @hspacept(3)@ @lib.check_number(vol,50)@@meas[3]@.
