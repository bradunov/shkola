Roof of the warehouse has the shape of a true quadrangular pyramid, @name[ind]@ = @lib.dec_to_str(data)@@meas[1]@. The opposite sides of the roof, corresponding to the edge @"a" @, are inclined @slope[ch[1]]@@meas[4]@ towards the base, and the other two sides are inclined @slope[ch[2]]@@meas[4]@ towards the base.
To cover one square meter of the roof, @numb@ tiles are needed.
