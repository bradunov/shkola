Through the extreme point of the ball's diameter, a plane is set up, towards which this diameter is inclined at an angle of @angle[ch]@@meas[3]@. The diameter of the ball is @diam@@meas[1]@. 
What are the circumference and the surface area of the intersection of the plane and the ball?
What is the distance of the intersection from the center of the ball?
(Take @"π"@ = @"22/7"@, write the results to one decimal place.)
