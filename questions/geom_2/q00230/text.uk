A plane is placed through the end point of the diameter of the ball, to which this diameter is inclined at an angle of @angle[ch]@@meas[3]@. The diameter of the ball is @diam@@meas[1]@. 
@vspace@
What are the circumference and the surface area of the intersection of the plane and the ball?
@center@ The circumference is @hspacept(5)@  @lib.check_number(circ)@@meas[1]@.
@center@ The surface area is @hspacept(5)@  @lib.check_number(area)@@meas[2]@.
@vspace@
What is the distance of the intersection from the center of the ball?
@center@ The distance is @hspacept(5)@  @lib.check_number(numb[3])@@meas[1]@.
Take @"π"@ = @"22/7"@, write the results to one decimal place.
