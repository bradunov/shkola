The bungalow is in the shape of a regular hexagonal prism, the length of the base edge is @lib.dec_to_str(numb[1])@@meas[2]@ and the length of the bungalow is @lib.dec_to_str(numb[2])@@meas[2]@. It has two round windows with a diameter of @lib.dec_to_str(numb[5])@@meas[2]@ and a rectangular door with a width of @numb[3]@@meas[1]@ and a height of @lib.dec_to_str(numb[4])@@meas[2]@ (picture).

The bungalow needs to be painted (the floor is not painted). If 1@meas[4]@ of paint covers @lib.dec_to_str(unit)@@meas[3]@, how much paint is needed to paint the entire bungalow?  
@center@ To paint the bungalow (to one decimal place)
@center@ @lib.check_number(result)@ @meas[4]@ @hspacept(5)@ of paint is needed.
