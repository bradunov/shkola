The surface of the cone is a segment of a circle. The area of that circle is @numb[4]@@meas[2]@. Calculate the surface area and volume of the cone.

@center@ The surface area of the cone is @hspacept(3)@ @lib.check_number(area)@@meas[2]@.
@vspace@
@center@ The volume of the cone is @hspacept(3)@ @lib.check_number(vol)@@meas[2]@.
