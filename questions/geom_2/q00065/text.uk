The lengths of the sides of triangle "ABC" are "AB" = 3 units, "BC" = 1 unit, and "CA" = 2 units. Points "D, E" and "F" are the midpoints of the sides of the triangle, and point "H" is the foot of the altitude from vertex "B" (see image).
Calculate "DH" = 1 unit.
Explain why. Triangle "CHE" is isosceles, "HED" = 30°, "EH" = "EC".
By the Law of Cosines, triangle "DHG" is similar to triangle "ABC".
Therefore, "DH" = 1 unit.
