In a tank in the shape of a cube
@center@ @quest[1]@, @hspacept(6)@ @quest[2]@, @hspacept(6)@ @quest[3]@,
there is @vol@ liters of water (1 liter = 1@meas[3]@). A concrete cube with edges of @edge@@meas[1]@ was lowered into the tank.
By how many centimeters did the water level in the tank rise, and what is the depth of the water after the cube is submerged (calculate to one decimal place)?

@center@ The depth of the water after submerging the cube is
