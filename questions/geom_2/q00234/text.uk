Calculate the surface area and volume of a sphere with a diameter of @numb@@meas[1]@. Then calculate the volumes of a cube, a regular cylinder, and a regular cone, which have the same surface area as the sphere. (Take @"π"@ = @"22/7"@, write the results to one decimal place.)  
@center@ The surface area of the sphere is @hspacept(5)@  @lib.check_number(area,50)@@meas[2]@.
@center@ The volume of the sphere is @hspacept(5)@  @lib.check_number(vol,50)@@meas[3]@.
What is the ratio of the volumes of these shapes to the volume of the sphere? 
@center@ The volume of the cube is @lib.check_number(out[1])@% of the volume of the sphere.   
@center@ The volume of the cylinder is @lib.check_number(out[2])@% of the volume of the sphere.
@center@ The volume of the cone is @lib.check_number(out[3])@% of the volume of the sphere.
