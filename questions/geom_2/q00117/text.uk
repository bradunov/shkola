The labels of the parallelogram elements are given in the picture. "O" is the perimeter and "P" is the area of the parallelogram.
Based on the given data: 
qst1 = [value of qst1][measurement unit 1], qst2 = [value of qst2][measurement unit 2], qst3 = [value of qst3][measurement unit 3],
calculate: 
out[1] = [ans1 rounded to 35 decimal places][measurement unit 4], out[4] = [ans2 rounded to 35 decimal places][measurement unit 5]. 
(Calculate with three decimal places and write the results to one decimal place).
