Finish marking the points and lines on the picture so that:

The point @"a"@ is located in @"RS"@, point @"c"@ includes points @"P"@ and @"R"@, and line @"d"@ intersects with @"S"@. 

Point @"b"@ is parallel to point @"a"@, line @"c"@ intersects with line @"d"@ at point @"O"@, and point @"Q"@ is on line @"b"@.

Display the picture using the @mycanvas()@ tag.
