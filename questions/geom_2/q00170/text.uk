Points @"A"@ and @"B"@ are on the @note@ of the plane π. The distance of point @"A"@ from the plane is @numb[1]@ @"cm"@, and the distance of point @"B"@ from the plane is @numb[2]@@"cm"@.

If the length of the segment @"AB"@ = @numb[3]@@"cm"@, determine the length of its orthogonal projection on π (to one decimal place).

The length of the orthogonal projection @"AB"@ on π is
@center@ @point[3]@@point[4]@ = @lib.check_number(numb[4])@@"cm"@.
