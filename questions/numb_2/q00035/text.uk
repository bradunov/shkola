If they start at the same time and run in the same direction, they would pass through the starting point simultaneously for the first time after @hspacept(3)@

Up until that point, 
@center@ @ime1@ would have run @lib.check_number(value[1], 20)@ @word[1]@, and
@center@ @ime2@ would have run @lib.check_number(value[2], 20)@ @word[2]@.
