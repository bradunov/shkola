A @length@@meas@ length of wood is cut into @piece@ @meas@ pieces. How many pieces are cut and how much  wood is left over?
@vspace@
Fill in the blanks to represent the problem as division:
@center@ @lib.check_number(length)@ : @lib.check_number(piece)@ = @lib.check_number(numb)@ @name@ @lib.check_number(rest)@
@vspace@
Check the solution by multiplication:
@center@ @lib.check_number(piece)@ * @lib.check_number(numb)@ + @lib.check_number(rest)@ = @lib.check_number(length)@
