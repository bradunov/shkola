@padez@ requires a total of @total@ @meas@ of water to make a solution for spraying the orchard, and there are containers of @small[ch]@ and @big[ch]@ liters. Water is taken from the faucet and excess water can be poured out. How can @ime@ measure exactly @total@ @meas@ of water the fastest way?

Instructions: In each row, show how @ime@ measures the amount of water in that pouring (from larger to smaller container -->, from smaller to larger container <--, without pouring from one container to another for measuring -/-).
