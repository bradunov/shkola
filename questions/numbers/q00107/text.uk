                                A @length@ cm long strip is divided into two parts, so that one part is @factor@ times longer than the other. 

How long is each section?

@vspace@
The shorter part is @hspace@ @lib.check_number(short)@ cm long,
and the longer part is @hspace@ @lib.check_number(long)@ cm long.
