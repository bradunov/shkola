In a car factory, @white@ white and @black@ black cars were produced in one month. 

How many cars were produced in total that month?  
@center@ @lib.check_number(result,40)@

How many cars would be produced in total if @diff@ more white cars were produced?  
@center@ @lib.check_number(value,40)@

By how much should the number of black cars produced be reduced so that the total number of cars produced that month remains the same?
