Which part of the rectangle's surface in the picture is covered by a smaller rectangle whose length is equal to \(\frac{@enum[1]@}{@denom[1]@}\) of the length of the given rectangle and whose width is equal to \(\frac{@enum[2]@}{@denom[2]@}\) of the width of the given rectangle? 
Color the smaller rectangle and calculate.
