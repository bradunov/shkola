The wire was cut into pieces with the following lengths: 
@center@ @numb[1]@ @name[1]@ of @part[1]@@"cm"@,  @numb[2]@ @name[2]@ of @part[2]@@"cm"@, @numb[3]@ @name[3]@ of @part[3]@@"cm"@, @numb[4]@ @name[4]@ of @part[4]@@"cm"@, and @numb[5]@ @name[5]@ of @part[5]@@"cm"@.
Complete the table with the given data as started below:

@center@ @mycanvas()@

What would be the length of each piece if the wire was cut into the same number of pieces, but of equal length? Write the result to two decimal places.
@center@ The length of each piece of wire would be @hspacept(3)@ @lib.check_number(aver, 40)@@"cm"@.
