This is a graph of a linear function. 
@center@ @mycanvas()@
Write down the coordinates of points "A" and "B" from the picture. 
@center@ "A = (@lib.check_number(ax, 20), @lib.check_number(ay, 20))", "B = (@lib.check_number(bx, 20), @lib.check_number(by, 20))",
the equation of the line is "y = @coef@x", 
and the x-intercept is "x = @zero@".
