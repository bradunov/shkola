The pool needs to be filled with @total@ liters of water. How much water needs to be poured from the water supply, which is at @temp[1]@@mes[1]@, and how much water heated to @temp[2]@@"°C"@ needs to be added to the pool to reach the temperature of @temp[3]@@"°C"@?
Write the corresponding system of equations (write all coefficients that are different from 0). Write the solution to one decimal place.
