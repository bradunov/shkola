@name[1]@ is walking home from school and covers @vel[1]@ meters per minute. At that moment, her brother @name[2]@, who started from home to school at a speed of @vel[2]@ meters per minute, is @free[2]@ meters away from school. After how many minutes @"t"@ and at what distance from school @"r"@ did they meet?
