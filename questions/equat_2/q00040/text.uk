Reduce the equation 
@center@  @quest[1]@  
@center@ = @quest[2]@
to an equation of the form 
@center@ @"P(x) = 0"@,
where @"P(x)"@ is a polynomial in decreasing order of degrees of the variable @"x"@ with integer coefficients.

Is the equation linear? @hspace@ @lib.check_one_option_dropdown(msg, reply)@
